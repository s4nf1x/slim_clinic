          <div class="description">
            <p>Tirzepatide comes in the form of a multiple dose injectable vial that you can inject subcutaneously into the stomach, thighs, or the back of your upper arms. As a precaution, it is recommended that you rotate the areas chosen for each injection. This can help you to avoid experiencing redness and irritation at the injection site.</p>

            How often

          <div class="description">
            <p>You can choose any day of the week, whatever is most convenient for you. However, once you’ve chosen a specific time frame, you must commit to administering the medicine on the same day every week for consistency. If, at any point, you decide to change the day you would typically take your dose, you will need to allow 72 hours to pass before taking your next dose to recalibrate your dosing schedule.</p>

          <div class="description">
            <p>If you miss a dose, try to take it as soon as you remember. You’ll have four days (96 hours) to administer the missed dose before your next scheduled dose. However, if it’s been more than four days, skip the missed dose and take your next dose on the regularly scheduled day. Also, try to avoid taking two doses within three days of each other. This can help reduce the risk of double dosing, which can cause further complications.</p>
