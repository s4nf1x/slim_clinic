            <h2>What Is Tirzepatide</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="description">
            <p>Tirzepatide is GLP-1/GIP medication synthetically produced as a treatment for people with Type 2 diabetes. Known as a “twincretin,” Tirzepatide is the first and only dual glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) receptor agonist that utilizes the effects of the GLP and GIP incretin hormones to help manage insulin release and lower blood sugar levels. Thanks to this process, patients can eliminate a substantial amount of excess body fat by using Tirzepatide for weight loss.</p>
