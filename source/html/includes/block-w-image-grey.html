              Tirzepatide is only available with a prescription, which you can only obtain from a licensed healthcare provider. They can evaluate your medical history, assess your current health status, and determine whether the medication is appropriate for you. In these cases, it’s usually best to receive your prescription from an established and reputable weight loss clinic that can help you use the medicine effectively as a weight loss treatment.
